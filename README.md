# [ARCHIVED]
I highly recommend checking out:
- [bmio](https://github.com/coyote963/bmio). It's a python library that makes rcon scripting for Boring Man way more easy.
- [rcon_scripts](https://github.com/Boring-Man-Tools/rcon_scripts). It's a collection of rcon scripts written using bmio.

I'm archiving this repository because I will not maintain it. Feel free to fork it if you need updates.
